# Baseline MLOps

This is a simple Iris model application.

The purpose of this is as a placeholder for any MLOps project. You can immediately start to build the automation pipeline for your projects.

Once your team has finished the backend, frontend, model, whatever, you can replace this placeholder with your actual project.
